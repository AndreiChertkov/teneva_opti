# teneva_opti


## Description

Collection of various optimization methods (search for the global minimum and/or maximum) for multivariate functions and multidimensional data arrays (tensors). This library is based on a software product [teneva](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva). See also related benchmarks library [teneva_bm](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_bm).


## Installation

> Current version "0.3.1".

The package can be installed via pip: `pip install teneva_opti` (it requires the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language of the version 3.8 or 3.9). It can be also downloaded from the repository [teneva_opti](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_opti) and installed by `python setup.py install` command from the root folder of the project.

We test optimizers with benchmarks from [teneva_bm](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_bm) library. For installation of additional dependencies (`gym` and `mujoco`) for `agent` collection , please, do the following (for existing conda environment `teneva_opti`; if you are using a different environment name, then please make the appropriate substitution in the script):
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_bm/main/install_mujoco.py && python install_mujoco.py --env teneva_opti && rm install_mujoco.py
```

> In the case of problems with `scikit-learn`, uninstall it `pip uninstall scikit-learn` and then install it from the anaconda: `conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn`.


## Documentation and examples (TODO)

Please, run the demo script:
